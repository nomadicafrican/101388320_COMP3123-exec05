6. Explain the Purpose of express.Router() in the Code Above.

Why is express.Router() used in Express.js applications, and how does it benefit the code structure?

Ans: express.Router() is used to organize routes in Express. It allows one to group route handlers together and keep the application modular by separating concerns.

7. Error Handling in Express.js

How would you implement error handling in the Express routes to ensure that any issues (such as file not found or server errors) are appropriately handled? Provide an example.

Ans: in Express, error handling is implemented using middleware. You can define a function that takes four parameters (err, req, res, next) and handle errors with them.

for example: 
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  res.status(500).json({message: 'Something broke!'});
});
